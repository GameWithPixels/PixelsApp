# PixelsApp

Mobile (iOS only for now) and Windows app that connects to the Pixels dice.

With this app you may create and preview patterns, activate profiles and manage presets.

## Patterns

Lighting patterns let you customize how a dice will light up.
There's a wide spectrum of possiblities, from a simple flash of colors to a rainbow effect, or more advanced effects such as waterfall, rotating rings, etc.

## Profiles

Profiles define when and how your dice will light up. A profile is made up of a list of rules.
Each rule associates an event (for example *roll is equal to 1*, or *dice is picked up*) with an action
such as playing a luminous pattern on the die or an audio clip in the app.

## Presets

A preset associate any number of dice with specific profiles to activate.
It's quick way to switch all or a subset of your dice to different profiles at once.
