# PixelsApp

Mobile (iOS & Android, phones only) and Windows app that connects to Pixels dice.
Please note that the Windows app is a rendering the UI as it would on a phone, it's not optimized for desktop screens.

The app is available on the Apple App Store [here](
  https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixels-the-electronic-dice/id1532993928
) and on Google Play [here](
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SystemicGames.Pixels
).

With this app you may create and preview LED's animations, activate profiles and manage designs.

Find our online guide [here](https://github.com/GameWithPixels/PixelsApp/wiki/Pixels-App-Guide).

## Foreword

Pixels are full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be
customized to light up when and how you desire.
Check our [website](https://gamewithpixels.com/) for more information.

## Animations

Animations let you customize how a dice will light up.
There's a wide spectrum of possibilities, from a simple flash of colors to a rainbow effect, or more advanced effects such as waterfall, rotating rings, etc.

## Profiles

Profiles define when and how your dice will light up. A profile is made up of a list of rules.
Each rule associates an event (for example *roll is equal to 1*, or *dice is picked up*) with an action
such as playing a luminous pattern on the die or an audio clip in the app.

# Build

## iOS (iPhone)

You'll probably need to change the bundle identifier, sign the device with your own certificates
and remove manual provisioning profile setup by Unity in Build Settings.

If you get a `MapFileParser.sh: Permission denied` error, check this [link](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-mapfileparser-dot-sh-permission-denied-when-building-xcode-project-built-from-windows-directly-to-a-macos-shared-folder).

Also don't forget to tell iOS to trust your app certificate in `General/Profiles & Device Management/Apple Development` on your iPhone.

## Android (phones)

Nothing specific.
